This library generates both formal and informal greetings using a first name, last name, and an optional language preference. The greetings can be easily integrated throughout the application, with support for English and Spanish.

Designed as a reusable, framework-independent library, it ensures compatibility without interfering with other application code. It features a simple, user-friendly syntax: G$(). Additionally, the library is compatible with jQuery, allowing any jQuery element passed in to return with a greeting.

This concept is inspired by Anthony Alicea's teachings and approach to creating flexible, reusable libraries
